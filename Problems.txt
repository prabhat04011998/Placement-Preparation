MY RESUME IS NOT OUTDATED
I AM IN 3rd sem only


Kaggle is a good resource for verified datasets 

Yes, I have participated in competitions

Precision is less as of now, I am improving.

parallel computing
maybe we need to look
data is biggggg
take sample

tradeoff between data and accuracy

gpu power
My college has gpu support
google colab
parallel programming
threads
multiple cores

cores?
task manager?
big games??
cache memory is faster
bus speed

c++ 
python - interpreted language 
(it runs every line, execute it and takes time)



c++ - compiler based
(whole program at once)
(C++ generates .out file, that is platform independent)


(HR round it is, be soft)
career
data science
Research - curious to learn 
problem solving
analytical

motivated
patience for results

I did my best
and i learned a lot eg m1 chip was new to me
I am confident
m1 chip....
architecture but i will learn more on it

youtube 

no constraints, I am flexible.
sure
no red flags


questions
feedback
work culture
in corona times, in reserach, how is it going
work from home

end it

em


Complexity of the problem - O(mn)

returning the answer to all the paths in a string
v.push_back(s);

just update it with c++;

if is 0 that means no obstacle there
 if(matrix[i-1][j-1] == 0)


 cross-validation

 repeat

 yes because underfitting

 feedback
 internal or customer directed
 sounds great excited to work on the same 
 hoping 




 Tell about features of Term deposit
 Decision Trees

 Underfitting – High bias and low variance 
 Overfitting – High variance and low bias
  
  lets say we have a data with 99 perc 1 and 
  1 per 0 then the machine learn
  will get to know from test data
  it doesnot work in test dataaa

  he might be reading from GFG
  Don't read please

  We penalize the dataset
  L1 and L2
  ridge and lasso

  when we have multiple local minima

  learning rate

  to use the probability

  sigmoid

   Confusion Matrix · 2. Type I Error · 3. Type II Error · 4. Accuracy · 5. Recall/ Sensitivity/ TPR · 6. Precision · 7. Specificity · 8. F1 Score.



   battery switch is not on
   ON it
   do it fast 
   it is going to turn off soon

differenet type of data
like circular


preprocessing
NULL values
multi class data or binary

Decision tree??


open notepad

Importing libraries
I will read  the data from pandas

y_target = data['Survived']
x_train = data[['Pclass', 'Age', 'Sex', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare','Embarked', 'Ticket']]

train.isnull().sum() we will check for NULL values
